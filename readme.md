### 2. Regression equation iteration ###
Introduction: In forward-looking adjustments, the regression equation is used to predict changes in credit risk. This section introduces how to use regression analysis for parameter selection and optimization.
Code: Use the statsmodels library for regression analysis and traverse different regression models (such as linear regression, ridge regression, etc.).
Input and output: The input is macroeconomic data and endog, and the output is the coefficient of the regression model.

### 3. Macro factor forecasting ###

Introduction: Forecasting macroeconomic factors is the basis for forward-looking adjustments. This section uses autoregression as an example.
Code: Use tools like statsmodels or autoarima for time series forecasting.
Input and output: The input is macroeconomic time series data, and the output is the forecast value for the next few periods.
